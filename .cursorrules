# Cursor Rules for My Project

## General Guidelines
- Follow the project's existing design language and color scheme.
- Use **CSS variables** (defined in the global stylesheet or Tailwind config) for all colors â€” **never** hardcode colors.
- Match spacing, typography, and component styling with existing components in the project.

## UI Components
- Always use the existing shared UI components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, etc.) before creating new ones.
- When creating new components, place them in the `/components` directory and ensure they are reusable and modular.
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary; prefer utility classes or Tailwind.

## Code Style
- Follow the project's ESLint & Prettier configuration.
- Keep components small and focused; if a component exceeds ~100 lines, consider splitting it.
- Avoid deeply nested JSX; extract into subcomponents where possible.

## Feature Implementation
- For new features, follow these steps:
    1. Create/update necessary database models in Prisma.
    2. Create API routes in `/app/api` or `/pages/api` following REST or RPC style consistent with the project.
    3. Build UI components that consume these APIs.
    4. Ensure all text, labels, and UI strings are consistent with the tone of existing app copy.

## Judge0 Integration
- Never hardcode Judge0 API URLs or keys; load them from environment variables.

## Testing
- Test new UI with realistic data using mock API responses before connecting to the backend.
- Ensure all Prisma schema changes are migrated and tested locally before committing.
